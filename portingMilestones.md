# Rust Port Milestones

This file is the control plane for the Codex loop. The goal is to move tested, user-visible capability from OCCT-backed paths to Rust-owned paths in bounded slices.

## Working Rules

- A turn only counts as progress if it does at least one of these: deletes or narrows an OCCT fallback, expands a Rust-owned capability, or adds regression coverage for newly Rust-owned behavior.
- Do not spend two consecutive turns only reshaping helpers inside one function unless the second turn removes a fallback or lands new tested behavior.
- Stay on the exercised kernel slice first: `ported_geometry`, `brep`, `document`, `pipeline`, and their integration tests. Do not drift into placeholder `occt_port/DataExchange` files just because they are easy to touch.
- If a bounded cut stalls for one turn, record the blocker in `nextStep.md` and move to the next task inside the same milestone.

## Turn Status

- Completed evidence: `rust/lean_occt/src/occt_port/ModelingData/TKBRep/BRepTools/brep/summary.rs` now threads `SummaryVolumeSource`, blocks `fallback_summary().map(|summary| summary.volume)` for supported offset solids, and resolves the exercised offset-solid volume through a Rust-owned face-contribution path that promotes a meshed planar cap only when the analytic planar integral numerically collapses. `rust/lean_occt/src/occt_port/ModelingData/TKBRep/BRepTools/brep.rs` exposes that root volume source on `BrepShape`, `rust/lean_occt/src/lib.rs` re-exports it, and `rust/lean_occt/tests/brep_workflows.rs` now proves the exercised offset-solid summary resolves through `SummaryVolumeSource::FaceContributions` while staying within the existing OCCT parity tolerance.
- Active milestone: `M2. Whole-Shape Summary Fallback Reduction`.
- Next bounded cut: use the new root summary source probes on the exercised swept-revolution solid, then remove the remaining shared `fallback_summary()` volume branch for supported swept solids and narrow the final whole-shape bbox fallback behind an explicit unsupported-shape guard instead of the current generic escape hatch.
- Verification:
  - `cargo fmt --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml`
  - `cargo check --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml`
  - `cargo test --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml --test brep_workflows ported_brep_uses_rust_owned_volume_for_offset_solids -- --exact`
  - `cargo test --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml --test brep_workflows`
  - `cargo test --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml`

## M1. Rust-Owned Offset Shell Bounding Boxes

Outcome: exercised offset shells and offset solids stop depending on the final shell-local OCCT bbox fallback in `offset_shell_bbox()` in `rust/lean_occt/src/occt_port/ModelingData/TKBRep/BRepTools/brep/summary.rs`.

Status: complete on 2026-04-16. The exercised `brep_workflows` offset-solid fixture now records `OffsetShellBboxSource::Brep`, and the unconditional `or(Some(shell_occt_bbox))` tier has been replaced by an explicit unsupported-shell guard that only leaves OCCT as an escape hatch when no prepared shell topology inventory exists.

Definition of done: the exercised offset fixtures in `brep_workflows` stay green, the winning shell bbox path is Rust-owned for those fixtures, and the final `or(Some(shell_occt_bbox))` tier is either removed for the exercised path or isolated behind an explicit unsupported-case guard.

Bounded tasks: make the shell-bbox winner observable, promote the nearest Rust-owned winner (`validated_shell_boundary_bbox`, `validated_shell_mesh_bbox`, or `validated_shell_brep_bbox`), then delete or strictly narrow the final fallback.

Verification: `cargo fmt --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml`, `cargo check --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml`, `cargo test --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml --test brep_workflows`, `cargo test --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml`.

## M2. Whole-Shape Summary Fallback Reduction

Outcome: `ported_shape_summary()` stops using `fallback_summary()` for bbox and volume on the supported analytic, swept, and offset families already exercised in `brep_workflows`.

Status: active. The exercised offset-solid bbox path now resolves through Rust-owned shell-union data tagged as `SummaryBboxSource::OffsetSolidShellUnion`, and the exercised offset-solid volume path now resolves through `SummaryVolumeSource::FaceContributions` without touching the shared `fallback_summary().map(|summary| summary.volume)` branch. The remaining `fallback_summary()` use in `ported_shape_summary()` is the final whole-shape bbox fallback plus the shared volume fallback for other families, so the next cut is to move the exercised swept-solid path off that remaining shared fallback and narrow the bbox escape hatch to explicitly unsupported shapes.

Definition of done: supported solids and shells under current tests resolve bbox and volume through Rust-owned paths plus validation, and any remaining `fallback_summary()` calls are behind explicit unsupported-shape guards instead of being the normal path.

Bounded tasks: identify each surviving `fallback_summary()` branch, replace one branch at a time starting with supported offset and swept cases, and add at least one regression that covers a family which previously fell through to OCCT.

Verification: same as M1.

## M3. Rust-Backed Traversal for Documents and Selectors

Outcome: `ModelDocument`, selectors, and high-level reports use `BrepShape` and `TopologySnapshot` for supported face and edge traversal instead of ad hoc OCCT subshape walks.

Definition of done: `document_workflows`, `selector_workflows`, and `recipe_workflows` stay green while the supported selector/report paths stop relying on raw `subshapes_occt()` for face and edge enumeration.

Bounded tasks: map one traversal-heavy read path at a time, switch it to `ported_brep()` or topology-backed data, then keep parity with the existing behavior through workflow tests.

Verification: `cargo test --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml --test document_workflows`, `cargo test --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml --test selector_workflows`, `cargo test --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml --test recipe_workflows`, `cargo test --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml`.

## M4. Public Query Fallback Cleanup

Outcome: supported public geometry query APIs are served end-to-end from the ported layer for the analytic, swept, and offset kinds already covered by `ported_geometry_workflows`.

Definition of done: the exercised supported query families remain green with added coverage for one newly cleaned-up public path, and OCCT helper fallbacks remain only for explicitly unsupported kinds.

Bounded tasks: remove redundant public fallbacks only after parity tests cover the same kind through the ported descriptor path, then keep unsupported cases explicit instead of implicit.

Verification: `cargo test --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml --test ported_geometry_workflows`, `cargo test --manifest-path rust/lean_occt/Cargo.toml`.
